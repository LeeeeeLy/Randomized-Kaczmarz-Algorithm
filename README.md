# Randomized-Kaczmarz-Algorithm
A semester project on Randomized Kaczmarz Algorithm

This project provides experiments about the performance of Randomized Kaczmarz’s
method that is introduced in the paper Strohmer and Vershynin (2009) : A randomized
Kaczmarz algorithm with exponential convergence compares to Classical Randomized
Kaczmarz’s method and Simple Randomized Kaczmarz’s method.
